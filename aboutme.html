      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p class="about-text">
        Hi! I’m <strong>Anuj KC</strong>, a passionate software engineer who
        loves turning ideas into interactive and functional web applications. I
        specialize in <strong>JavaScript, HTML, CSS</strong>, and frameworks
        like <strong>React</strong>. Building responsive and user-friendly
        interfaces is what excites me the most, and I enjoy learning new tools
        and techniques to improve my craft.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        Over the past few years, I’ve worked on personal projects ranging from
        <strong>portfolio websites</strong> to small <strong>web apps</strong>.
        Each project has helped me sharpen my coding skills, experiment with new
        technologies, and focus on writing clean, efficient code while providing
        a great user experience.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        I completed my
        <strong>SEE (Secondary Education Examination) in 2023</strong> with a
        GPA of <strong>3.7</strong>. I also have experience with
        <strong>Git and GitHub</strong> for version control and collaboration,
        and I’ve participated in <strong>inter-school tech programs</strong> to
        enhance my knowledge and gain practical experience in coding and
        teamwork.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        I’m constantly driven by curiosity and the desire to create solutions
        that make a difference. My goal is to build
        <strong
          >efficient, interactive, and visually appealing applications</strong
        >
        that not only work well but also delight users. Feel free to explore my
        <a href="project.html">projects</a> or
        <a href="emailme.html" target="_blank">get in touch</a> — I’m always
        excited to collaborate, learn, and build something amazing!
